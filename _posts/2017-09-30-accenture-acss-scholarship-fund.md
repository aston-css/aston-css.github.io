The ACSS/Accenture Scholarship Fund is a brand new fund that we've created with the help of [Accenture][Accenture].

Accenture help meet their client's business solutions through strategic, technological and digital methods and we've got some really strong relationships with them.

We've had a long standing relationship with Accenture for many years now, however we've decided to kick that up a notch this year, with the ACSS/Accenture Scholarship, a newly created fund.

## What?
During one of our weekly committee meetings, the committee came up with the brilliant idea of a scholarship fund, to allow ACSS members to attend technology events which they otherwise could not afford, either due to travel or the event itself costing too much.

We, as a society, believe that all of our members should be able to attend awesome events, like [Hackference][Hackference], a technology conference/hackathon, and [Hack The Burgh][Hack The Burgh], a hackathon held up in Scotland.

## When?
During that very same committee meeting, our wonderful Chair announced that [Accenture][Accenture] had asked us to apply for sponsorship. So we did and they approved of our amazing idea for an ACSS/Accenture Scholarship!

We're hoping to run the scholarship throughout the year, in the hope that it'll allow members to attend more events and make us an even greater society.

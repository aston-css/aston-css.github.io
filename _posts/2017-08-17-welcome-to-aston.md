First of all, welcome to Aston!

First thing you need to know about the Aston Computer Science Society is that we're here for people who just love  technology.

You don't need to be a Computer Science student, or someone who's even remotely good with technology - all you need is an interest in technology.
We all know how hard University can be so we've made a quick list of things we'd recommend you do!

## 1. Keep up-to-date

We've mentioned this before, but we'd seriously recommend you subscribe to our mailing list which you can do [here][Mail] so you can keep up to date with all the things we've got going on!

We'd also recommend following us on [Twitter][Twitter], liking our [Facebook page][Facebook] and joining our [Facebook group][Facebook Group] as we tend to announce a lot of important news (including news about our very own hackathon - [AstonHack][AstonHack]).

We'd also recommend you check out our [Calendar][Calendar] if you don't have (or like) social media so you can be up to date with all the events we've got planned this year.

## 2. Come along to hackathons!

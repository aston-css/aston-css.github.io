First of all, welcome to Aston!

First thing you need to know about the Aston Computer Science Society is that we're here for people who just love  technology.

You don't need to be a Computer Science student or even remotely good with technology - all you need is an interest in technology.
We all know how hard University can be so we've made a quick list of things we'd recommend you do!

## 1. Keep up-to-date

We've mentioned this before, but we'd seriously recommend you subscribe to our mailing list which you can do [here][Mail] so you can keep up to date with all the things we've got going on!

We'd also recommend following us on [Twitter][Twitter], liking our [Facebook page][Facebook] and joining our [Facebook group][Facebook Group] as we tend to announce a lot of important news (including news about our very own hackathon - [AstonHack][AstonHack]).

We'd also recommend you check out our [Calendar][Calendar] if you don't have (or like) social media so you can be up to date with all the events we've got planned this year.

## 2. Come along to events!

Now we know it's a scary (but hopefully exciting) experience, so we hope that you'll dive right in to ACSS events and the best way to start is by coming to our welcome event (tbc)! You'll find out about what we've got planned for you and about our awesome events!

Even if you come along to a couple of our socials or maybe pop along to the odd tech event, we'll make sure that there's something for you.

Although we host loads of events throughout the year, our biggest event is our yearly hackathon called [AstonHack][AstonHack], which we've been hosting for the past two years, with this year being our third event, and we'd strongly recommend you come along for 24-hours of hacking and learning!

Hackathons are huge invention marathons which are usually 24 or 48 hours long, and participants (otherwise known as hackers) invent awesome websites, apps and hardware hacks which they show off to all the other participants at the end of the event!

## 3. Get involved in Brum tech community

One of the best features of Birmingham (apart from the city itself of course) is the amazing tech community which is alive and buzzing around the city.

As well as AstonHack, other Universities also host 

We'd strongly recommend you get involved in them and this year comes with a special twist! We've recently aquired sponsorship from [Accenture][Accenture] to provide the **ACSS/Accenture** Sponsorship, which is a special fund for those who want to come along to tech events, but otherwise couldn't afford to do so.
